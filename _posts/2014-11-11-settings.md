You can quickly add your app config items to the admin panel with the Setting class. Registering a configuration item as a setting will add it to the admin panel, and use 
whatever value is stored in the database to override your config setting. The value set in your config will be the default value. 

```
Setting::register([
    'key' => 'app.url',
    'group' => 'General',
    'name' => 'App URL',
    'type' => 'input'
]);
```
